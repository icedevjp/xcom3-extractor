# XCOM Apocalypse data extractor
Helper classes for data extraction from XCOM Apocalypse data files.

The goal is to extract data directly from raw .iso file in relatively short time.

## features
- custom ISO9660 archive support. (at least file format that Steam release of xcomapoc uses)
- loading palettes
- extracting PCK/TAB sprites (cityscape)

planned: loading buildings (.BLD) and cityscape tile data (CITYMAP.DAT)
